# Kickstarter-Analysis-update Louise in her fundraising efforts 
##purpose of the project is to assist Louise in her fundraising efforts internationally and to issue report on the findings of fundraising launches.  
#Project Background
#Perform data analytics for Louise in order to determine how fundraising launches were executing in different countries using various data analytic tools.
#Projected Approach and Strategies
#Perform data analytics on Outcomes regarding Goals, Theatre and other Launch Outcomes with analyses of Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, First and Third Quantiles and add up the results of differences of same.
#Analysis and Challenges
#Challenges were to determine the best approach to the data sets and the outcomes provided by the data sets.
#Challenges with Programs: MSExcel â€“ PNG and Other Images 
#Challenges with MSExcel is that different versions were available and outcomes were different depending on Excel version used.  The same can be said about the images in that some of the Pivot Charts were difficult to export as PNG and other image files so they were kept as new sheets in the Master Kickstarter.xls file.
#Project Findings
#GB and the US fundraising results were unexpected and should be used as a baseline for future fundraising events.
#Projected Results
#Some fundraising launches produced no funds.  Some launches did very well even without much support and some launches that were heavily supported, did not do well at all.
